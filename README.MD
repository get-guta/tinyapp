# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). It also allow users to register new url, edit url, and delete url. A new user should be registered first to login.
Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
